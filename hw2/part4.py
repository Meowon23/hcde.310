# HW2 Part 4 – Your first functions
#
# In `part4.py`, turn code you already wrote into functions:
#
# 1. `works_by(artist, artworks)` → returns a list of titles by that artist, from the list you pass in
#    (an empty list if there are none)
# 2. `count_by_artist(artworks)` → returns your counting dictionary from Part 3
# 3. Replace each `TODO` docstring with one line saying what the function takes and what it returns
#
# Don't change the `print` lines at the bottom of `part4.py`. `check.py` uses them.
