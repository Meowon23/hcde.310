# HW3 Part 1 – Read the response first

AI Use: Stage 2 (Tutor)

Open `sample_response.json` (a saved Art Institute of Chicago search). In `notes.md`:

---

## 1. The total number of results is at `data["pagination"]["total"]`. What's the path to the first artwork's title?
data["data"][0]["title"]

## 2. Find 3 more fields you'd want to show a user, and their paths
data["data"][0]["place_of_origin"] - where the piece was made
data["data"][0]["medium_display"] - what it's made of (oil on canvas, etc.)
data["data"][0]["dimensions"] - how big it is

## 3. Which fields are `null` for some works?
Only artist_title is null in your sample, for “Baroque Pearl Mounted as a Cat Holding a Mouse” (data["data"][2]["artist_title"]), since its artist is listed only as “Spanish or south German”.

## 4. Predict
*open `fetch.py` and read it, but don't change anything yet. What do you think will happen when you run it?*
it will asks for search term, if type something, and then it crashes on the requests.get(url, params=params) line. url is an empty string, so requests has nowhere to send request

## 5. Run it
*run `python3 fetch.py`. When it asks for a search term, type a word (like `cat`) and press Enter. What actually happened? Read the traceback bottom line first: what went wrong, and which line of your file caused it?*

Search the Art Institute for: cat
Traceback (most recent call last): ....... 
requests.exceptions.MissingSchema: Invalid URL '': No scheme supplied. Perhaps you meant https://?
